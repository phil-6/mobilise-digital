        <h2>Forming our own Community</h2>

        <p>We understand life as a contractor can sometimes be a solitary one with long hours in different cities, sometimes hundreds of miles away from your family. We also understand how professionally isolating this life can be and as part of the Mobilise Digital network, we want to give you the option of joining your own community to aid in development of your career.</p>

        <p>Working Out Loud is a way to build relationships that help you achieve a goal, develop a skill, or explore a new topic. Instead of networking to get something, you invest in relationships by making contributions over time, including your work and experiences that you make visible.</p>

        <p>Working Out Loud Circles, the peer support groups, help you experience the benefits for yourself.</p>

        <p>When you Work Out Loud, your contributions over time build trust and deepen a sense of relatedness, increasing the chances for cooperation and collaboration. You're more effective because you have access to more people, knowledge, and opportunities that can help you. You feel better too, because your bigger network of meaningful relationships give you a greater sense of control, competence, and connection.</p>

        <p>All of that leads to more motivation for individuals, and to more agility, innovation, and collaboration for an organization.</p>

        <p>Currently used by many companies around the world, you can see some examples for yourself below:</p>
