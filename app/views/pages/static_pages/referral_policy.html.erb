        <h2 class="text-center">Referral Scheme for Mobilise Digital Professional Members</h2>

        <p>
          Mobilise Digital will be offering its members the chance to take part and benefit from a referral scheme in
          which they will be paid an ongoing commission for any candidate referred to and working with Mobilise
          Digital.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each professional member of Mobilise Digital has the right to refer any suitably qualified candidate to our
          network and share in the profits generated by that individual when they take up a Mobilise Digital contract.
          An amount of £10 per working day is paid to the referrer of any candidate, regardless of the length, day rate
          and conditions of the contract. The intention behind the referral scheme is to reward our members loyalty, by
          allowing them to generate a second/passive income, which is not a benefit offered by any other company in the
          market.
        </p>
        <p>Referral rules and guidelines:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            All professional members have the right to refer any qualified colleague/contact/friend to the Mobilise
            Digital network.
          </li>
          <li>
            Any time a referred contact accepts a project with Mobilise Digital, a payment of £10 for each working
            day their new candidate completes will be paid to the referrer.
          </li>
          <li>
            When referring a candidate, we operate a first come first served basis.
          </li>
          <li>
            All referrals must be made to members@mobilise.digital along with the following:
            <ul>
              <li>Referred members CV</li>
              <li>Contact details</li>
              <li>Details of how the permanent employee knows the candidate (will be verified)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Payment of referral bonus</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The referral payment is paid every quarter in the form of a cash bonus.
          </li>
          <li>
            Anyone who has referred a new member will receive a breakdown of the bonus on a separate document to
            your invoice, with a full breakdown of who you have referred – and how much your referral/s have earned you
            during the quarter.
          </li>
          <li>
            If a permanent staff member has resigned or has their contract terminated, they shall no longer be able
            to participate in this scheme.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The idea of this referral scheme is to allow all members to monetise their contacts/knowledge base of people
          and generate a secondary passive income. It is not designed, nor will it be profitable enough to take
          precedence over any current/future Mobilise Digital work/projects.
        </p>
